      ## Workflow Automation - Vacation Rental example

      ![Airtng](http://howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/airtng-screen.png)

      At its core this use-case is about enabling your service providers
      (agents, hosts, customer service reps, administrators, etc) to better
      serve their customer. To illustrate a very real-world example of this
      use-case we will implement a webapp for finding and booking vacation
      properties--we're calling it Airtng. Here's how it works:

      1. A host creates a vacation property
      2. A guest requests a reservation on that property
      3. The host receives an SMS notifying them of the recent reservation request. The host can either Accept or Reject the reservation.
      4. The guest is notified that their reservation was either accepted or rejected.

      ## Building Blocks

      We'll be using the Twilio REST API to send our users messages at important junctures:

      * [Sending Messages with Twilio API](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages)

      and Python + [Flask](//flask.pocoo.org/)
      as our web technology stack:

      * [Getting Started with Flask](//flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/)

      Let's get started! Click the right arrow to move on to the next step of

      ## Users and session management

      For this workflow to work, we need to have users created in our application,
      and allow them to log in into airtng.
      Each user will hold his personal information, which will be required when the
      moment to send sms notifications come.

    :markdown
      ## Vacation Property
      In order to build a true vacation rentals company we'll need a way to
      create the property listings.

      The `VacationProperty` model belongs to the `User` who created it
      (we'll call this user the _host_ moving forward) and contains only two
      properties: a `description` and an `image_url`.

      It has two associations in that it has many reservations and therefore
      many users through those reservations.

    :markdown
      ## The Reservation Model

      The `Reservation` model is at the center of the workflow for this application.
      It is responsible for keeping track of:
        * the `vacation_property` it is associated with

        * the `guest` who performed the reservation

        * status of the reservation


  .step(data-title="Reservation Creation",
    data-file='airtng_flask/views.py',
    data-highlight='98-123')
    :markdown
      ## Reservation creation

      The reservation creation form holds only one field, the message that will
      be sent to the _host_ user when reserving one of his properties. The rest
      of the information necessary to create a reservation is taken from the user
      that is logged in into the system and also the relationship between a property
      and it's owner.

      A reservation is created with a default status `pending`, so when the _host_
      replies with a `confirm` or `reject` response, the system knows which reservation
      the _host_ is referring to.

      In the next step we'll take a look at how the sms notification is sent to
      the host when the reservation is created.


  .step(data-title="Reservation Creation",
    data-file='airtng_flask/sms/sms_sender.py')
    :markdown
      ## Notifying the host

      When a reservation is created for a property, we want to notify the owner
      of said property that someone has made a reservation. For this purpose we use
      an abstraction called [`SmsNotifier`](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/airtng-flask/blob/f8220038dea94f5ecc43e5069e9eaf3d6c846a47/airtng_flask/services/sms_notifier.py)
      , which uses, under the hood, another abstraction called `SmsSender`.

      This one is where we use [Twilio's Rest
      API](//www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/sms/sending-via-rest)
      to send a sms message to the _host_, using your [Twilio phone
      number](//www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming).

      As you can see, sending sms messages using Twilio is as easy as the code
      to your right shows. Now we just have to wait for the host to send an sms
      response accepting or rejecting the reservation, so we can notify the guest
      and host that the reservation information is updated accordingly.

      The next step shows how to handle and configure the host's sms response.

      ## Handling Incoming Messages

      Let's take a closer look at the code on the right. That
      method handles our incoming Twilio request and does three things:

      1. Checks for a pending reservation from the incoming user

      1. Updates the status of the reservation

      1. Responds to the host and sends notification to the guest.

      ## Incoming Twilio Request
      In your [Twilio number](//www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming)
      you must setup the sms web hook to call your
      application's end point in the route `/reservation/confirm`. Remember to
      to expose your development machine to the outside world using
      [ngrok](//ngrok.com/). So, your url for the sms web hook on your number
      should look like this:
      ```
      http://<subdomain>.ngrok.io/reservation/confirm
      ```

      An incoming request from Twilio comes with some helpful
      [parameters](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/sms/twilio_request#request-parameters).
      These include the `From` phone number and the message `Body`.

      We'll use the `From` parameter to lookup the host and check if she has any
      pending reservations. If she does, we'll use the message body to check if she
      accepted or rejected the reservation. Then, we update the reservation status and
      use the `SmsNotifier` abstraction to send an SMS to the _guest_ notifying him the
      the decision the host made, regarding the property reservation..

      ## TwiML Response
      Finally, we'll use [Twilio's TwiML](//www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/sms/replying-to-sms-messages)
      as a response to Twilio's server
      instructing it to send sms notification message to the _host_, specifically the
      [Message verb](//twilio-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/twiml.html#message)
      from TwiML to instruct Twilio's server that it should send the message.

      ## All Done

      Congrats! You just learned how to automate your workflow with Twilio SMS.

      To improve upon this you could add anonymous communications so that the host
      and guest could communicate through a shared Twilio phone number.
      Hmmm... maybe we'll have to put together a tutorial on that!
